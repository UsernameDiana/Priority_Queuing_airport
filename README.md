# Airline Network with a prioritising queue

We have implemented a PersonHeap class in our AirlineNetwork.
The Heap is a minHeap so the root is allways the person with the highest priority, ranging from LateToFlight class = 0, to Monky class = 4.
A part from the randomiser not being very random, the implementation is working very well.
